# StochasticVirusChain
This repo contains code that simulates a chain/web of stochastic particles connect by neo-Hookian springs,
contained in Single_Chain and Whole_Virus respectively. Estimating_Epsilon.ipynb is a file that contains
the code for estimating the parameters of the viral web system.

This code accompanies a set of mathematical theory contained in my proposal via an algorithm of my own design.
I have not uploaded my proposal as it is not yet ready to be published, however it can be requested via ltyih@math.ubc.ca.

There exist .mp4 videos of viral simulation under Whole_Virus/Simulations if one would wish to see the output.
